    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    C8:5F:19:D3:03:C3:E0:F4:6F:4B:09:F4:F8:52:00:05:76:A9:24:5A

    C8:5F:19:D3:03:C3:E0:F4:6F:4B:09:F4:F8:52:00:05:76:A9:24:5A

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
